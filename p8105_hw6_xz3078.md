## Problem 1

### Data Cleaning

``` r
set.seed(123)

birthweight = read.csv("./birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(recode(babysex, "1" = "Male", "2" = "Female")),
         frace = as.factor(recode(frace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other", "9" = "Unknown")),
         malform = as.factor(recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present")),
         mrace = as.factor(recode(mrace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other")))

any(is.na(birthweight))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Thereâ€™s no missing data in the dataset.

### Test for relationship between birthweight and each variables

``` r
par(mfrow = c(3,5))
plot(x = birthweight$bhead, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$blength, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$delwt, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$fincome, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$gaweeks, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$menarche, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$mheight, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$momage, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$parity, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$pnumlbw, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$pnumsga, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$ppbmi, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$ppwt, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$smoken, y = birthweight$bwt)
plot(x = birthweight$wtgain, y = birthweight$bwt)
```

``` r
plot_sex = birthweight %>%
  group_by(babysex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt, color = babysex)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "density plot of bwt by babysex")
plot_mrace = birthweight %>%

plot_malform = birthweight %>%
  group_by(malform) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt, color = malform)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "density plot of bwt by malform")

(plot_sex + plot_malform) / (plot_mrace + plot_frace)
```

We can see from the plots that bhead and blength seem to have linear
relationships with birthweight.

From the anova test above, we can see the bhead, blength, babysex,
delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, mheight, momage, mrace, ppwt, wtgain are
all related to birthweight since their p value are extremely small.

### Plot of model residuals against fitted values

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + delwt + fincome + frace + gaweeks + mheight + momage + mrace + ppwt + wtgain, data = birthweight)
birthweight %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point() 
```

    ## Warning in predict.lm(model, data): prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be
    ## misleading

![](p8105_hw6_xz3078_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

To build my model, I first find the variables that have clear linear
relationship with birthweight and then do the hypothesis test to find
other potential significant variables. Finally, I put all variables in
one model.

### Compare models

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>%
  mutate(
    mod_1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + delwt + fincome + frace + gaweeks + mheight + momage + mrace + ppwt + wtgain, data = .x)),
    mod_2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    mod_3 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength +bhead * babysex + babysex * blength + babysex * blength * bhead, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_mod_1 = map2_dbl(mod_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod_2 = map2_dbl(mod_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod_3 = map2_dbl(mod_3, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

![](p8105_hw6_xz3078_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

From the violin plot above, we can see that model 1 has the least rmse
among all three models. This means that the model I built is better
compare with the other two.
